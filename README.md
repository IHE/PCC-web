# PCC-web
Web content from PCC for profiles.ihe.net

This GitHub repo is where the content is managed prior to approval to publish. This repo would not replicate content managed in other ways, such as standalone GitHub Repo for an IG authored implementation guide Profile.

# Layout

* PCC home page following look and feel pattern 
  * Maternal page as a front door for those interested in Maternal topics

# Prototype review

The content of this repo is published at https://ihe.github.io/PCC-web/ for the benefit of committee review. This is NOT the final publication location, which is on the profiles.ihe.net.

The content here will need to be transformed by Mary to the publications github, and ultimately the profiles.ihe.net web site.
